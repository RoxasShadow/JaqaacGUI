Just a qaac GUI in order to encode your AAC/ALAC faster.

If you want to use the standalone version, be sure to have installed qaac, eac3to, the relative libraries and the Apple Application Support.
If you want to use the installer, just run the setup and then AppleApplicationSupport.msi.
You can find all you need in 'Downloads'.
